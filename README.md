# oconcept-tv

Welcome to tv.bcreativ.org!

An experiential art project to send us back to the time where we would watch an actual tv, with a proverbial remote control. See your own reflection in the tv the way we once did with an old box tv set.

The remote actually works! Play around with it. 

This project tests the user's nostalgia, while providing interesting and controversial channels to click through, and accompanying information overlaying the right-side art panel.
